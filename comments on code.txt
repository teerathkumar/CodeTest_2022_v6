Hello Sir, Hope you are doing great.
--------------------------
Overall code was good, structured and as per MVC rules, but few line of code were there, 
so I minimized those by using ternary operation and made that one line code.
--------------------------
Also there were some variables declared in class and defined in constructor like mailer and logger in repository, 
but these variables were not used in rest of the methods, new objects of those classes in the methods were defined 
instead of using those class variables. So I refactored those.
--------------------------
For testing the specific methods, we can use filters, like 

What I used in my past, is to create a test class of some controllers of class, a class will be created automatically via php artisan make:test command,
then we add the functionality in method with prefix of test_ and run test by following command:

php artisan test --filter %somename_of_test_class%
and then this will show the test fail or success with time of execution.
